# Welcome to my /now page ðŸ‘‹

This is where I display my current state of mind and what I am about.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m exploring zettelkasten to start taking permanent notes I can actually use and reuse to write articles, record videos and produce online courses. So far the most comprehensive resource is located [here](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/) and I am using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)
- ðŸ’» Iâ€™m currently learning about creative frontend development (Threejs, GSAP, locomotive scroll), hoping to build some nice and useful visual experiences in the future.
- ðŸ’¬ If you are looking for volunteers to teach French, English or computer science anywhere in Asia, reach out to me by email.
